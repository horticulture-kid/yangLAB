Hi, I am a postgraduate student of Nanjing Agriculture University at the DL Yang Lab. My research interests include Rice disease resistance and development, bioinformatics.

I am learning more about disease resistance researches, programming (R & perl & Linux Shell) and statistics due to my limited skill levels.
